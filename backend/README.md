# Backend - Placeholder for Future Sprints

## Status
⏳ **Not yet implemented** - This folder structure is reserved for future backend development.

## Current Setup
The application currently uses **Supabase** for backend services (authentication, database, storage).

## Future Implementation
This folder will contain the Flask backend in a future sprint, including:
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- AI modules
- Database models
- Authentication middleware

## For Now
**No backend setup required!** The frontend works independently with Supabase.
